<h1>TVPulse</h1>

<p>My first "serious" application in <strong>React</strong>. The latter aims to retrieve data from The Movie Database API, concerning the most popular tv shows at the moment and to list them in dynamic form through a user interface that is quite friendly to use. As of August 7, 2023, this application is not yet functional due to the fact that I am only starting it, nevertheless at the end of this I could host it on Vercel directly from this repository while therefore allowing you to have a visual and programmatic insight into the design of a React App.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the design of this application I obviously use React with Vite, which works more efficiently with React than its basic configuration which also contains a plugin which is no longer relevant. It is therefore better to initialize a project with Vite in addition to have a solid base at the present time. I also use Axio for https requests to simplify how the code retrieves responses and errors and Bootstrap. Feel free to check out the json package to know what you need to install in the dependencies to recreate this project.</p>

As expected, the deployment has been carried out to allow you to have a real display of the application with Vercel. To see the result online <a href="https://tv-pulse.vercel.app">click here</a>.
