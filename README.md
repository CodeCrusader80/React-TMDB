<h1>FilmPulse</h1>

<p>My first "serious" application in <strong>React</strong>. The latter aims to retrieve data from The Movie Database API, concerning the most popular films at the moment and to list them in dynamic form through a user interface that is quite friendly to use. As of August 7, 2023, this application is not yet functional due to the fact that I am only starting it, nevertheless at the end of this I could host it on Vercel directly from this repository while therefore allowing you to have a visual and programmatic insight into the design of a React App.</p>
